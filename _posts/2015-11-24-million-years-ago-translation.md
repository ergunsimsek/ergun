I only wanted to have fun
Learning to fly, learning to run
I let my heart decide the way
When I was young
Deep down I must have always known
That this would be inevitable
To earn my stripes I'd have to pay
And bare my soul

I know I'm not the only one
Who regrets the things they've done
Sometimes I just feel it's only me
Who can stand the reflection that they see

I wish I could live a little more
Look up to the sky, not just the floor
I feel like my life is flashing by
And all I can do is watch and cry
I miss the air, I miss my friends
I miss my mother; I miss it when
Life was a party to be thrown
But that was a million years ago

When I walk around all of the streets
Where I grew up and found my feet
They can't look me in the eye
It's like they're scared of me
I try to think of things to say
Like a joke or a memory
But they don't recognize me now
In the light of day

I know I'm not the only one
Who regrets the things they've done
Sometimes I just feel it's only me
Who never became who they thought they'd be
I wish I could live a little more

Look up to the sky, not just the floor
I feel like my life is flashing by
And all I can do is watch and cry
I miss the air, I miss my friends
I miss my mother, I miss it when
Life was a party to be thrown
But that was a million years ago
A million years ago

我于纵乐，切飞切行。
我于心载，及笄炳炳。
知其必然，争其坦然。
非我所依，所为悔极。
非我不依，心镜通明。
若身久矣，极目穹宇。
白驹过却，青衫长泣。
游息所交，甚念至亲。
觥筹百年，交错难弃。
旧巷野草，顾盼难凝。
几欲探问，惊骇行人。
非我所依，所为悔极。
非我不依，失梦未及。
若身久矣，极目穹宇。
白驹过却，青衫长泣。
游息所交，甚念至亲。
觥筹百年，百年难弃。
