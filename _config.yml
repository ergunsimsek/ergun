name: Ergun Simsekoglu 
bio: Previously Intern @Twitter and Spotify. Study at Rice University in Computer Science with a focus on artificial intelligence.<br/>After completing high school with the Certificate of Honor, I was fortunate enough to be awarded a scholarship to study my B.Sc. Degree at Texas A&M University and later on, continuing to study at Rice University in United States.<br/>I studied Computer Science to learn programming languages to become a codemaster and have a better understanding web and mobile development. I'm the first qualified international student to get a T-STEM scholarship, and I also had the honor of being accepted into the NASA Aerospace scholars program.<br/>Besides publishing on my Medium page, I also write articles for F1 Racing Türkiye, the world’s best-selling Formula 1 magazine. I speak three languages: native Turkish, English, and proficient Italian. In my spare time, I obsessively work out, go for run and enjoy playing basketball.<br/>My goal is to one day work in Formula 1 team as a Race Engineer. F1 is my passion and it has put me where I am today. I’m learning and working hard every day to achieve that goal. Formula 1 is all about performance, numbers, analysis, and simulation. You always need to be calm, positive and stay positive.<br/>I like to try new technologies and make my hands dirty. I check new frameworks, coding styles and approaches as something new come up. Please check out my GitHub page for my recent codes.<br/>Lastly, I write an ebook it is called 'Amerika'da Öğrenci Olmak' it is an awesome handbook for those new International Students in America. I share all my experiences and some useful tools that, will help them to survive. Unfortunately, now it is only in Turkish. You can purchase by clicking here.
